# Minesweeper

Minesweeper in python using Depth First Search algorithm

### Progress ðŸš§
23rd September: Working on GUI. Added a basic working main menu.

Now fully playable on easy difficulty!
That said it's definitely not finished. Features like losing when mines are clicked, flagging, etc are missing. <br>
It technically is playable on all difficulties but the sprites need to be resized which I haven't done. <br>
UI will be reworked soon, sprites will be replaced with the new sprites.
